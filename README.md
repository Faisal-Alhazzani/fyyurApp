## Udacity Project 1 - Fyyur

## Introduction

This project has been done to fulfill the requirements of Udacity Full Stack Nano Degree Program.
Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies

Our tech stack will include the following:

- **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
- **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
- **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
- **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations

### 2. Frontend Dependencies

**HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/)

## Main Files: Project Structure

Overall:

- Models are located in the `MODELS` section of `app.py`.
- Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
- The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
- Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`

Highlight folders:

- `templates/pages` -- Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in `app.py`. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.
- `templates/layouts` -- Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.
- `templates/forms` -- (Already complete.) Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.
- `app.py` -- Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.
- Models in `app.py` -- Defines the data models that set up the database tables.
- `config.py` -- Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.
